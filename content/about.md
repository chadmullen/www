I'm a technologist, software engineer, and architect who's spent my career building systems that solve real problems. Currently, I work at AWS as a Senior Solutions Architect, but my path has taken me through hands-on development, infrastructure design, and everything in between.

## What I Do

I help organizations design and implement cloud solutions that scale. My current focus areas include building AI agents and agentic workflows, optimizing workload performance with edge services, and exploring how generative AI can solve real business problems.

Whether I'm writing code, designing architectures, or helping teams navigate technical decisions, I'm driven by the challenge of making complex systems work elegantly.

## Why I Write

I started this blog to share what I'm learning and help others navigate the rapidly evolving cloud and AI landscape. If something I write saves you time or sparks an idea, that's a win.

## Beyond the Cloud

When I'm not architecting solutions, I'm on a bike or spending time with my family in Colorado.

## Connect

The best way to reach me is on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chadmullen). I'm always happy to connect with fellow technologists.
